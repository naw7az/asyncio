One of the challenges for exascale algorithm design is to minimize or reduce synchronization. Synchronization takes more time than
computation, especially in distributed computing. Reducing synchronization drew attention from computer scientists for decades. 
Whereas it becomes an increasingly significant problem recently as the gap between the improvement of computing and latency increases. 
Experiments have shown that (global) communications due to synchronization on a distributed computers takes a dominated share in a sparse 
iterative solver.[2]
